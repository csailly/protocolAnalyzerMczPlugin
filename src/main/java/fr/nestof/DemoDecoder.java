/**
 * This is a very simple demo of how a protocol decoder is built with the nethome decoder framework.
 * The protocol decoders can be used with the ProtocolAnalyzer and the NethomeServer to decode
 * RF and IR protocols.
 * This DemoDecoder does not decode any real protocol, it simply interprets lengths of pulses and spaces
 * as 0 and 1. It serves to demonstrate how a real decoder would be written
 *
 * Note that the class is annotated as a "Plugin" which makes it possible for the ProtocolAnalyzer to load it
 * dynamically. All you have to do is to pack the class in a jar and place the jar in the "plugins" folder.
